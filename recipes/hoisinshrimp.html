    <img src="https://img.hellofresh.com/c_fit,f_auto,fl_lossy,h_1100,q_auto,w_2600/hellofresh_s3/image/61c1e52aafb71415a10ba7da-e2fec9ba.jpg">

    <p> If you're like us, you've seen a lot of stir-fries in your day. But thanks to our hoisin shrimp marinade, aromatic rice, and a sprinkle of nutty sesame seeds, this one is bound to top them all. It cooks super quickly and brings a tour de force of tangy, sweet, and savory flavors that even the pickiest of eaters will love. Sounds like a win-win to us.</p>

<h2> Ingredients </h2>

<ul> 
    <li> 2 unit - Ginger </li>
    <li> 1 clove - Garlic </li>
    <li> 3/4 cup - Jasmine Rice </li>
    <li> 2 tablespoon - Hoisin Sauce </li>
    <li> 1 tablespoon - Sesame Seeds </li>
    <li> 1 thumb - Ginger </li>
    <li> 1 unit - Lime </li>
    <li> 10 ounce - Shrimp </li>
    <li> 6 ounce - Green beans </li>
    <li> 2 teaspoon - Vegetable oil </li>
    <li> 1 tablespoon - Butter </li>
    <li> Salt </li>
    <li> Pepper </li>
</ul>

<h2> Instructions </h2>

<ol>
    <li> • Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Peel and mince or grate ginger. Peel and mince garlic. Quarter lime.</li>
    <li> • Melt 1 TBSP butter in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add scallion whites and half the ginger; cook until fragrant, 1 minute.</li>
    <li> • Add rice, ¾ cup water (1½ cups for 4 servings), and a big pinch of salt to pot with aromatics. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. • Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.</li>
    <li> • While rice cooks, rinse shrimp* in cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Toss in a medium bowl with garlic, half the hoisin (all the hoisin for 4 servings), and remaining ginger. Season with salt and pepper. • Set shrimp aside to marinate for at least 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> • Meanwhile, trim green beans if necessary; toss on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. • Roast on top rack, tossing halfway through, until browned and slightly crisp, 12-15 minutes.</li>
    <li> • Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add marinated shrimp and cook, stirring, until shrimp are opaque and cooked through, 3-4 minutes. • Divide rice between plates; top with green beans and shrimp. Sprinkle with scallion greens and as many sesame seeds as you like. Serve with lime wedges on the side.</li>
