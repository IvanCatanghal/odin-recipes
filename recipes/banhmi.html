    <img src="https://img.hellofresh.com/c_fit,f_auto,fl_lossy,h_1100,q_auto,w_2600/hellofresh_s3/image/one-pan-pulled-pork-banh-mi-13e52a93.jpg">

    <p> Tonight's dinner features a favorite Vietnamese sandwich with a twist: pickled veggies are piled between toasty baguettes for a banh mi-inspired sammie, BBQ-style! Pulled pork is coated in tangy hoisin for a barbecue-like kick, then topped with cucumber, radishes, carrots, and a generous swipe of mayo. Top with a squeeze of lime juice, pile leftover veggies on the side, then prepare for total taste bud takeover. </p>

    </ul>

    <h2> Instructions </h2>
    
    <ol> 
        <li> • Wash and dry produce. • Trim, halve, and thinly slice radishes. Halve baguettes lengthwise. Halve cucumber lengthwise; thinly slice on a diagonal into half-moons. Quarter lime.</li>
        <li> • Place carrots and radishes in a medium microwave-safe bowl; toss with ponzu, half the vinegar (you'll use the rest later), 1/2 tsp sugar (1 tsp for 4 servings), and a big pinch of salt and pepper. • Microwave on high for 30 seconds. Set aside, stirring occasionally, until ready to serve.</li>
        <li> • Tear pulled pork* into smaller pieces if necessary. • Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add pork and garlic powder. Cook, stirring occasionally, until warmed through, 2-3 minutes. • Stir in hoisin, stock concentrate, remaining vinegar, and 1/4 cup water. Cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 1-2 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li> • While pork cooks, toast baguettes. • To bowl with carrot mixture, add cucumber and a squeeze of lime juice (juice from half the lime for 4 servings); toss to coat. Taste and season generously with salt and pepper. • Spread cut sides of top buns with mayonnaise. Fill buns with pork mixture and as many veggies as you like. Serve with remaining veggies and remaining lime wedges on the side.</li>
